# Particle Dynamics Simulation

This project simulates particles moving under forces of attraction and collision. It uses a QuadTree structure for efficient force calculations, visualizations for forces, velocities, and energy-based coloring.

## Features
- Particle collisions (elastic and wall collisions)
- Energy and momentum conservation
- Adaptive time step for stability
- Force and velocity visualization
- Energy-based particle coloring
- Logging for analysis

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pygame library

## Usage
Run the `particle_simulation.py` file:
```bash
python particle_simulation.py
