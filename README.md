# Particle Dynamics Simulation

This project simulates particles moving under forces of attraction and collision.

## Features
- Particle collisions (elastic/inelastic and wall collisions)
- Energy and momentum conservation
- Adaptive time step for stability
- Force and velocity visualization
- Energy-based particle coloring

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pygame library
